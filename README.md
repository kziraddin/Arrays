# Array Operations in Python

This project demonstrates how to perform basic fixed-size array operations in Python, such as inserting elements at the end, at the beginning, and at a specified index. It mimics low-level array behavior (like in C/C++) using pre-allocated lists.

---

## 📁 File Structure

- `array_ops.py`: Core logic for array operations.
- `test_array.py`: Unit tests written using Python's `unittest` framework.
- `README.md`: Documentation file (you’re reading it!).

---

## ⚙️ Features

- Insert a value at the **end** of the array
- Insert a value at the **beginning**
- Insert a value at a **specific index**
- Input validation for:
  - Index bounds
  - Capacity overflow
- Console-based user interaction (in `__main__` block)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Run the Program

```bash
python3 arrays -.py
```

You’ll be prompted to enter the maximum capacity of the array and then perform insertion operations via a simple menu.

## 🧪 Running Unit Tests

We use the built-in unittest module to test the core functionality.

```bash
python3 -m unittest test_array.py
```

## ✅ Example Test Output
```bash
    .INFO:root:
    Cannot insert. Array is full.
    ...INFO:root:
    Out of range.
    ..INFO:root:
    Cannot insert. Array is full.
    .
    Invalid index.
    .
    Invalid index.
    ........

  OK
```

## 🔍 Logging

To make tests cleaner, we use the logging module instead of print() for error messages like:

"Cannot insert. Array is full."

"Out of range."

This allows for better testing and redirection during unit tests.


## 🛠️ Future Work
 ➕ • Add support for deletion at a given index.

 🔍 • Add search functionality. (added)

 🧮 • Make it dynamically resizable (like Python lists).

 ✅ • Add more comprehensive unit tests (e.g., edge cases, bulk inserts, deletes).

 🧾 • Store log and error messages in a file using Python logging handlers.

## 🧪 Planned Tests

• We plan to include more detailed unit tests for:

• insertAtEnd(): Test capacity overflow, insert when partially filled.

• insertAtBeginning(): Insert into empty and full arrays, shifting all elements.

• insertAtIndex(): Insert at start, middle, end, and test for invalid indices and full array.
